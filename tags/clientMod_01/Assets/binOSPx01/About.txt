Code snippets & bits ported/derived from:
  - OSP (ET port)
  - NQ (screenshake)
  - wolfX (zoomedFOV..)       

Code is mainly derived from ET |& wolfX. Some parts of the
code are directly ported while other parts just act the same 
while work differently in the back end. I claim no credits 
for it either way, only credit I claim is the time that was 
used to port/recreate it & effort to make it work..

ABOUT:
--------
OSPx (in short: OSP x (unattended)) is basically a partial
client clone of OSP mod with few enhancements.

Client mod is a part of a OSPx project, which aim is to
recreate OSP mod and enhance the experience so 
it's up to more modern times. OSPx (once released)
will be full blown 1.4 client-server side mod, 
which will basically be a clone of OSP with few enhamcements.

This mod is a client mod only, it's meant to work 
with any 1.4 server-side mod (Shrub, Bani..) 
thus it's lighter in features. In it's current form it 
is NOT meant as replacement for OSP client nor any 
other client sided mod. 

This mod was created simply because I wanted some 
of the OSP features on server-only mods.

! Read Docs/Features.txt to see what was added/changed.
! If you have any Q's visit the forum or contact me.
! Source code is currently unavailable. It will be released
  with OSPx project.
