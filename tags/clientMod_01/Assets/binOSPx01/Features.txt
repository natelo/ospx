cg_crosshairPulse

  by other players' bullets.
  
cg_bloodFlash
  Specifies intensity of the red blood "flash" when taking damage.
  
cg_crosshairAlpha
cg_crosshairAlphaAlt
  Specifies the transparency of the crosshair (Alt is for the
  secondary crosshair).  Note "cg_crosshairHealth" must be
  set to 0 for this option to be enabled.

cg_crosshairColor
cg_crosshairColorAlt
  Specifies the color of the crosshair (Alt is for the secondary
  crosshair).  0x-escape is of the format 0xRRGGBB, where RRGGBB
  specify the Red/Green/Blue channels respecitively.  Each value
  is in hexidecimal format (00-FF).  For color naming, most common
  color names are available.  Note "cg_crosshairHealth" must be
  set to 0 for this option to be enabled.  String colors that
  are available for use:
		"white"
		"black"

		"green"
		"blue"

		"magenta"
		"cyan"
		"orange"

cg_drawWeaponIconFlash
  0 - Weapon icon flashing not enabled
  1 - Outline of weapon icon is colored based on weapon state:
		Red = Firing
		Yellow = Reload
		White = Switching
		
cg_printObjectiveInfo
  0 - No printing of objective messages in the console (center-print only)
  1 - Objective messages show up in both console and center
  
cg_muzzleFlash
  0 - Local flash effect is NOT seen when firing current weapon.
  1 - Weapon flash effect is shown when weapon is fired.
  
cg_complaintPopUp
  0 - Disables the auto-popup of the teammate complaint request for
      being killed by a teammate.
  1 - Auto-popup of teammate complaint request enabled.
        
cg_drawReinforcementTime
  0 - Team reinforcement time not drawn on the active HUD.
  1 - Shows team reinforcement time on the active HUD.

cg_noChat
  0 - Will act as default and print all chats.
  1 - Will disable Team and Global chats. Chats will still be visible 
      in console, player just wont see it in game (HUD). 
  
cg_noVoice
  0 - Act as default.
  1 - Disables any Global voice chats and only plays Team voice chats
  2 - Disables Team voice chats and only plays Global voice chats.
  3 - Disables all Voice chats. 
  NOTE: This only disables drawing and playing of chats, player can still use Vsay
        but (s)he just wont see/hear it.
 
cg_zoomedFOV  
  90-120 - A value of FOV (field of view) it will zoom to when player hold down +zoomView key.
  
cg_zoomedSens
  0.01-2.00 - Mouse sensitivity percentage when in zoomed (+zoomView) view. E.g. 1.00 = 100%.. 
  NOTE: This is not actual mouse sensitivity but rather a scale up/down of
        player's current sensitivity. I.e. 1.00 will produce same sensitivity
        in zoomed view as player has by default while 0.8 will 
        produce 80% sensitivity or in other words, will make mouse 20% slower
        in zoomed view than player has normally/when not in zoomed view.
        
cg_noAmmoAutoSwitch
  0 - Weapon is NOT switched if completely out of ammo
  1 - Weapon is automatically switched if completely out of ammo        
         

New commands (Long):
---------------------
+zoomView is a toggle button for zoomedFOV. 
  Zoomed FOV is basically a fancy FOV (Field Of View) toggle.
  When player will hold down a key it will zoom in/out 
  (depending of cg_zoomedFOV and player's cg_FOV setting),
  once key is released it will revert back to default FOV.
  NOTE: cg_zoomedFOV value can only be set between 90 and 120. 
        Anything out of boundaries will revert to 90 or 120.
        This is to ensure that zoomed FOV falls into general
        PB restricted values on most of the servers. 

+vstr gives customizable "+" command support.  That is, with
      +vstr, a player has the ability to execute a command when a
      key is pressed, and another command when the same key is
      released.

	Format: bind <some_key> +vstr <var1> <var2>

	e.g.
		set some_var "say HEY!"
		set another_var "say There!!"
		bind o +vstr some_var another_var

		pressing o results in:  "HEY!"
		releasing o results in: "There!!"
		
^8 +colors 
  There are 32 color escape codes in the UI and cgame modules.  
  From the normal ^0 - ^7, the following are also available:

	- ^8, ^9, ^<, ^>, ^:, ^=, ^?, ^@
	- ^A - ^O   (note, caps MUST be used to get the proper color)
	- For future compatibility with Main/, use ^p (lower case) for
        the color black.   
  

Modifications (Long):
----------------------
- Screenshake
  Default RTCW screenshake is annoying and given me countless
  of headaches..so default shaking code was replaced with one
  from et NQ mod, which less dizzy and more eye friendly.

- Demo Interrupted Connection fix
  Just a small fix that solves "connection interrupted" print
  when user is viewing demo with timescale set lower than 0.5

- Modified few HUD prints
  Mainly few cosmetic fixes so default warmup prints are not so dull. 
  
- Map levelshot image
  Fixed missing map image on map loading when player uses custom resolution.
